# Calculator

Calculator task from the odin project. Though the calculator works,
there a handful of other operations I intend for it to perform. Some,
I have integrated within the code to be activated when I pick up the 
project at a later date; others require me to deepen my JavaScript 
Knowlegde.

This task was fun and the most important thing is the knowledge I 
gained while researching to complete this project.
